<h2 align="center"><b>Projects</b></h2><br>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/Duncan-code/Face-recognition-attendance-system">Face recognition</a>, one of the best 
    projects that took my skills into practice, was the project that was presented
     at the end of the course in partial submition requirements for the degree certificate at Zetech university. 
     The project could take lively video of a person and mark him/her present in a company's database register. The interface
     overview of the system is s shown below;

      However , I have been able to build <a href="https://github.com/Duncan-code">websites</a>, I have taken part
       together with team,
       in troubleshooting different problems encountered in websites. </p>
       <p>I initiated a project aimed at addressing the inefficiencies in the IT asset management system at Kenbro
         Industries Limited. The existing system was outdated, leading to difficulties in tracking and managing IT assets.
        Statement of the Problem was;
        The primary problem was the lack of an efficient IT asset management system, resulting in:
        <ul>
        <li> Inaccurate tracking of IT assets.</li>
        <li> Increased time spent on locating and maintaining assets.</li>
        <li> Difficulty in planning for future IT needs and upgrades.</li>
        <li> Seldom errors in information systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Project Methodology & Planning.<br>
        The project methodology involved the following steps:
        <ul>
        <li> Conducting an assessment of the current IT asset management process.</li>
        <li> Identifying key areas of inefficiency and potential improvements.</li>
        <li> Monitoring the system's performance and making necessary adjustments.</li>	
        </ul>
        <br>
        Project Execution
        <ul>
       <li> Assessment: Collected data on existing IT assets, including computers, software, and network equipment.</li>
       <li> Design: Created a comprehensive plan for the new asset management sys-tem, incorporating features for tracking 
        asset
         location, status, and mainte-nance history.</li>
       <li> Implementation: Rolled out the new system in the IT department, provided training sessions for staff where 
        necessary, and addressed initial challenges.</li>
       <li> Monitoring: Continuously monitored the system's effectiveness, gathered feedback from users, and made</li>
         iterative improvements based on their in-put.
        </ul>
         <br>
